# [Agents Of Change: The Internet](https://magazine.artland.com/agents-of-change-internet-net-art-how-the-world-wide-web-has-affected-the-way-we-make-art/)  

- “Net Art functions only on the net and picks out the net or the “net myth” as a theme”.
- ”connectivity, global reach, multimediality, immateriality, interactivity, and equality“
- "the elements of communication networking, sharing and collective authorship"  

I think the internet creates a space that exceeds the physical space, even the time. It connects many different parts of the world.
### *The Random Darknet Shopper*
I was surprised that you can make a shopping bot that can easily access the deep web. It can see all the data in the deep web and actually buys a random one. I feel the deep web is so far from me. By unpacking and showcasing, the items from the deep web are shown to the public. And the law for the bot (and other new things like the copyright for AI) is still not clear, no one is even going to be charged.


# [Rhizome's Net Art Anthology](https://anthology.rhizome.org/)
[The World in 24 Hours](https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-world-in-24-hours) by Robert Adrian is a work linking 16 cities in the world where each site has an hour to generate and transmit content. This work shows how the network can bring different parts of the world all together and exchange information. Cyberspace is a space beyond the physical space and time. This work was created in 1982, which is a very early period throughout internet history as the official birthday of the internet is January 1, 1983. Before this time, “various computer networks did not have a standard way to communicate with each other”.[^1] Therefore, connecting different computers from different places was very challenging at the time when Adrian made The World in 24 Hours.  

When I see this work nowadays, I still feel very impressed by his concept of bringing different parts of the world together via the Internet. Today, the internet has developed a lot, 5G has been introduced, and social media is popular, all of which makes the exchanging of information and communication from different parts of the world so much easier. People can easily see what is happening on the other side of the world. This work also reminds me of an art piece I made last year (the photo is below). I found these moon photos on social media. All of these were taken on the same day, the mid-autumn festival in 2023, from different countries across the world, each representing a continent. I was inspired by a Chinese poem “the moon was rising from the sea; all the people were sharing this moment”. It talks about the fact that no matter where people are, as long as they see the moon, they are looking at the same moon at the same moment. So basically, the moon is like a symbol to connect us. When I was a child, when I missed someone, I usually stared at the moon, seeking a connection with that person or society, maybe inspired by this poem. However, in this work I was kind of questioning this idea - are we really looking at the same moon at the same moment? Obviously, although they were all taken on the same day and time, they are not at the same moment because of the time zone difference. It raises the discussion about space-time and the relationship between time and distance. But because of the internet, I am able to gather the “same moment” moon across the world and put them together. The internet connects people all together.
