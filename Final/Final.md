### Fine Art Page

I divided my art pieces into six sections.  
I developed from the midterm version by showing them all in the same size, which looks much more neat.

## Code Snippet

I'm most proud of my main page's interactive elements. I got a good refresh on the p5.js code I made previously and fully understood everything in it by making the comments on explaining each line (refer to the comments in that file for my explanation of the coding and how it works).  
And I successfully brought it to fill my main page by setting it to be window size and used `z-index", "-1"` to make it be the bottom layer.

## Notes on:

### What you struggled with

Coding is a process going frequently between frustrated and excited. Whenever I get an idea, I need to first think of how to make it work and what methods I'm going to use. Many times it fails due to typos, missing some logic, or things just going unexpectedly. Then it's going to be the fixing parts. Sometimes it goes crazy and a lot of burnout. But finally, I made it, and very excited to see what I have in mind showing on my website.

### What youâ€™re proud of

I'm very proud that I finally have my first portfolio website, and I built it from scratch. Three months before, I knew nothing about html and css. I can't believe how far I've come.

### What you would add next if you had more time

I'll continue to build on my portfolio website by adding new works and refine details. What I have in mind right now is adding some text on my main page to encourage users to interact with it and a very short opening quote to introduce me. And add lazy loading for my images.
